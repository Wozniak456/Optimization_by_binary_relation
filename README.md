> ### The topic: Optimization by binary relation ###
<br>
This lab project is implemented in Python and focuses on optimizing binary relations. It addresses the following tasks:<br><br>

- Checking the acyclicity of a relation.
- If the relation is acyclic, the Neumann-Morgenstern algorithm is applied.
- Otherwise, K-optimization is performed.
- Additionally, the graphviz library is utilized for graph visualization.

> ### Prerequisites: ###
Before running the project, you need to install the graphviz module (to see graphs). You can follow the instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44005139.
